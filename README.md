## Stay Guided Astrology
The Stay Guided Site was developed for entertainment purposes. It is a way to get you daily horoscope from your guides.
When a user clicks on their astrological sign, a window pops up with a generated text(unique horoscope message) processed by the translator.

To run the app, you must log into rapid API and get your key as well as subscribe to the two API sources used. Input the key in lines 51 and 68 of the js code file where it says 'enter api key here'
